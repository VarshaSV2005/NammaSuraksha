During major calamities or violent/terrorist incidents, quick and seamless coordination between Fire Brigade, Ambulance Services, and Police is critical â€” yet often lacking. Emergency Response Coordination System (ERCS) is a platform designed to bridge the communication gap between these emergency services.

The system enables real-time information sharing, centralized command management, and synchronized action plans. It features:

Unified Communication Dashboard: A shared dashboard for Fire, Ambulance, and Police units to track incidents, assign resources, and update statuses in real time.

Incident Prioritization & Alerts: Automated incident classification and escalation based on severity, ensuring the right teams are deployed immediately.

Live Location Tracking: Real-time GPS tracking of emergency vehicles and personnel to optimize response time.

Resource Allocation Management: Dynamic assignment of available units and equipment depending on the type and scale of the emergency.

Secure Messaging: Encrypted communication channels between departments for sharing sensitive information.

Data Analytics & Reporting: Post-incident reports, performance analysis, and suggestions for improving future responses.
